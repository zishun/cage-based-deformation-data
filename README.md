# Cage-based Deformation Data

## Contents
* Stanford Armadillo: original mesh + cage + 10 deformed cages
  * The vertex orders in ```deformed_bounding_mesh(1,7,10).obj``` are not coherent with the others. I fixed them.
* Cyberware Horse: original mesh + cage + 4 deformed cages

These models are shared by the authors of:
> Tao Ju, Scott Schaefer, and Joe Warren. Mean value coordinates for closed triangular meshes. ACM SIGGRAPH 2005.

The control meshes (cages) are designed by John Morris. Please acknowledge them if you use these data in your work.
